# Alzheimer-s-Analysis-using-MRI
Project's Aim : To Estimate the CDR (scale of Dementia) using relevant features in the MRI dataset.

# What is Dimentia ? 
Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Memory loss is an example. Dementia is not a specific disease. It’s an overall term that describes a group of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person’s ability to perform everyday activities.

# Understanding the Data
This set consists of a longitudinal collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. Each subject was scanned on two or more visits, separated by at least one year for a total of 373 imaging sessions. For each subject, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in single scan sessions are included. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 72 of the subjects were characterized as nondemented throughout the study. 64 of the included subjects were characterized as demented at the time of their initial visits and remained so for subsequent scans, including 51 individuals with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. Another 14 subjects were characterized as nondemented at the time of their initial visit and were subsequently characterized as demented at a later visit.

# Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE)
The Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Folstein test is a 30-point questionnaire that is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment. It is commonly used in medicine and allied health to screen for dementia. It is also used to estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time; thus making it an effective way to document an individual’s response to treatment. The MMSE’s purpose has been not, on its own, to provide a diagnosis for any particular nosological entity.

Interpretations : 

Any score greater than or equal to 24 points (out of 30) indicates a normal cognition. Below this, scores can indicate severe (≤9 points), moderate (10–18 points) or mild (19–23 points) cognitive impairment. The raw score may also need to be corrected for educational attainment and age. That is, a maximal score of 30 points can never rule out dementia. Low to very low scores correlate closely with the presence of dementia, although other mental disorders can also lead to abnormal findings on MMSE testing. The presence of purely physical problems can also interfere with interpretation if not properly noted; for example, a patient may be physically unable to hear or read instructions properly, or may have a motor deficit that affects writing and drawing skills.

# Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)
The CDR™ in one aspect is a 5-point scale used to characterize six domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to Alzheimer disease and related dementias: Memory, Orientation, Judgment & Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home & Hobbies, and Personal Care. The necessary information to make each rating is obtained through a semi-structured interview of the patient and a reliable informant or collateral source (e.g., family member) referred to as the CDR™ Assessment Protocol.

The CDR™ Scoring Table provides descriptive anchors that guide the clinician in making appropriate ratings based on interview data and clinical judgment. In addition to ratings for each domain, an overall CDR™ score may be calculated through the use of an CDR™ Scoring Algorithm. This score is useful for characterizing and tracking a patient’s level of impairment/dementia:

0 = Normal
0.5 = Very Mild Dementia
1 = Mild Dementia
2 = Moderate Dementia
3 = Severe Dementia

# Estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV)
The ICV measure, sometimes referred to as total intracranial volume (TIV), refers to the estimated volume of the cranial cavity as outlined by the supratentorial dura matter or cerebral contour when dura is not clearly detectable. ICV is often used in studies involved with analysis of the cerebral structure under different imaging modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance (MR), MR and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), MR and Single-photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT), Ultrasound and Computed Tomography (CT). ICV consistency during aging makes it a reliable tool for correction of head size variation across subjects in studies that rely on morphological features of the brain. ICV, along with age and gender are reported as covariates to adjust for regression analyses in investigating progressive neurodegenerative brain disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, aging and cognitive impairment. ICV has also been utilized as an independent voxel based morphometric feature to evaluate age-related changes in the structure of premorbid brai, determine characterizing atrophy patterns in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), delineate structural abnormalities in the white matter (WM) in schizophrenia, epilepsy, and gauge cognitive efficacy.
